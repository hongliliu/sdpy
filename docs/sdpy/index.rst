sdpy stands for Single Dish OTF python mapping and contains tools for OTF
mapping and gridding for single-dish data.

Python codes for Arecibo, GBT, APEX, and TripleSpec data cubes.  Forked from
casaradio: http://code.google.com/p/casaradio

Renamed from "gbtpy" to "sdpy" to indicate that it isn't just for GBT but
for
all single dish heterodyne or other cubemaking machines.
